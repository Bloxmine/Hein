    <h1>Portfolio inspiration</h1>
    <p>Neocities is one of my main sources of inspiration for my portfolio site. Itâ€™s a site where people can host their custom made personal websites, akin to Geocities from the late 90s.</p>
    <img src="images/inspiration/neo.png" alt="Neocities" class="image">
    <p>Most sites on Neocities are not meant to be very professional looking. They are hobbyist projects, a place for people to showcase their works and own style.</p>
