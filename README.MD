# Hein Dijstelbloem

This is the markdown readme for my new website.

## About

I am Hein Dijstelbloem, a 22-year-old web developer from Helmond. This website serves as a showcase of my projects and a platform for me to learn more about web development.

## What you'll find here

The main purpose of this website is for me to test my creativity and explore what I can create. I am particularly interested in learning JavaScript and improving my skills in that area.

## Projects

I am currently working on this website and have several projects hosted here.

## Toggling seasons

You can toggle the snow, or other seasonal effects on this website by clicking the "Toggle (Season)" button.
